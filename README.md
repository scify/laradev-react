## About Laradev-React

**Laradev-React** is a sample Laravel app that can be used as a skeleton for your next Laravel project.

It includes a basic setup for both the backend and frontend, with support for both **DDEV** and **Native** (PHP, Composer, etc running locally) development environments.

## Features

1. Support for both **DDEV** and **Native** development environments
2. React.js/Inertia frontend with Vite for faster development
3. Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
4. SCSS support with PostCSS
5. TypeScript support
6. Automated code formatting (PHP, JS/TS, SCSS)
7. Git hooks for code quality
8. Comprehensive test suite using Pest
9. Role-based authentication using Spatie Permissions
10. Dark mode support
11. Responsive design
12. GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:**
  - Laravel 12.x
  - PHP 8.2+
  - MySQL/SQLite
  - Laravel Pint (Code Styling)
  - PHPStan (Static Analysis)
  - Pest (Testing)

- **Frontend:**
  - React 19
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - shadcn/ui Components
  - Vite
  - ESLint + Prettier

## Installation - Local Development

### PHP code style - Laravel Pint

This application uses [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/pint) in order to perform code-styling checks and fixes.

In order to run the styler, run :

```shell
./vendor/bin/pint --test -v # the --test will not do any changes, it will just output the changes needed

./vendor/bin/pint -v # this command will actually perform the code style changes
```

### Running tests

#### Backend tests

To run the tests, run the following command:

```shell
./vendor/bin/pest
```

To run with type coverage, run the following command:

```shell
./vendor/bin/pest --type-coverage
```

**Note:** depending nonyour environment, you may have to export the XDEBUG_MODE environment variable to enable code coverage:

```shell
XDEBUG_MODE=coverage ./vendor/bin/pest --coverage --parallel
```

To run against the `arch` presets (defined in `tests/Unit/ArchTest.php`), run the following command:

```shell
./vendor/bin/pest --arch
```

Or, under DDEV:

```shell
ddev test
```

To run the tests with coverage, run the following command:

```shell
XDEBUG_MODE=coverage ./vendor/bin/pest --coverage
```

To filter tests, use the `--filter` flag. For example:

```shell
./vendor/bin/pest --filter testName
```

#### Frontend tests

We use Jest for frontend tests.

To run the tests, run the following command:

```shell
npm run test
```

To run the tests with coverage, run the following command:

```shell
npm run test:coverage
```

### Code Scanning

This application uses [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) in order to perform code-scanning checks.

In order to run the code-scanner, run the following command:

```shell
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
```

### Git Hooks

The project includes pre-commit hooks that automatically format code. They're installed automatically with:

```shell
composer install
```

## Releasing a new version

After you have committed your changes, create a new git tag:

```shell
git tag -a vx.y.z -m "This is a nice tag name"
```

(for the `x.y.z` version number, follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines).

Then, push the tag:

```shell
git push origin vx.y.z
```

Then, in the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/scify/laradev-react/releases), create a new Release *
*and correlate it with the tag that you just created.**

Also, don't forget to update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with the new version name, release date, and release notes.
